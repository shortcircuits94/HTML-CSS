	<h1>The Hound of the Baskervilles</h1>
	
		<p>Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon his knee. &ldquo;You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the long s and the short. It is one of several indications which enabled me to fix the date.&rdquo; At the head was written: &ldquo;Baskerville Hall,&rdquo; and below in large, scrawling figures:
		&ldquo;1742.&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p>&ldquo;It appears to be a statement of some sort.&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the Baskerville family.&rdquo;</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		
		<q>Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo Baskerville, and as I had the story from my father&hellip;</q>
		
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr. Sherlock Holmes.</p>

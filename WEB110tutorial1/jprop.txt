Welcome
If you're looking for high-quality, hand-crafted
juggling and circus products, the J-Prop Shop is
the store for you. I've designed and built props
for the past 35 years, and my products have been
used by professional entertainers and hobbyists
throughout the world. Our prices are reasonable and
our quality is excellent.

Specials This Month
The following devil sticks are available at a
special discount for the entire month of May:

Basic Stick ($19.95)
The easiest stick to learn with, but "grippy" enough
for the most demanding tricks. Comes in red, green,
and blue.

Flower Stick ($24.95)
A graceful stick with colored tassels. Flower Sticks
float slowly, making them ideal for beginners.

Master Stick ($39.95)
Our most popular stick is shorter and heavier for
fast play and more advanced tricks. Each Master Stick
is available in custom colors.

Glow Stick ($29.95)
The Glow Stick shines brightly at night (without
the danger of a fire stick).

Quality Tested
Every item I create is checked and tested before
being shipped out to assure perfect quality. I take
pride in every one of my juggling props and I want
my customers to feel that same pride.

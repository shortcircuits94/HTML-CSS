"I am inclined to think—" said I.
"I should do so," Sherlock Holmes remarked impatiently.
I believe that I am one of the most long-suffering of mortals;
but I'll admit that I was annoyed at the sardonic interruption.
"Really, Holmes," said I severely, "you are a little trying at
times."
He was too much absorbed with his own thoughts to give any
immediate answer to my remonstrance. He leaned upon his
hand, with his untasted breakfast before him, and he stared at
the slip of paper which he had just drawn from its envelope.
Then he took the envelope itself, held it up to the light, and
very carefully studied both the exterior and the flap.
"It is Porlock's writing," said he thoughtfully. "I can hardly
doubt that it is Porlock's writing, though I have seen it only
twice before. The Greek e with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive.
But if it is Porlock, then it must be something of the
very first importance."
He was speaking to himself rather than to me; but my vexation
disappeared in the interest which

The War of the Worlds
H.G. Wells

Part 1
The Coming of the Martians

Chapter 1

No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth
century that this world was being watched keenly
and closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as mortal
as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various
concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost
as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise
the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of
water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this
globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of
their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under
the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the
older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought
of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible
or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits
of those departed days. At most terrestrial men fancied there
might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves
and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the
gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those
of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic,
regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and
surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth
century came the great disillusionment.

The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves
about the sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the
light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received
by this world. It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has
any truth, older than our world; and long before this earth
ceased to be molten, life upon its surface must have begun its
course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of
the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature
at which life could begin. It has air and water and all that is necessary
for the support of animated existence.

The Art of War
Sun Tzu

Chapter 1
Laying Plans
1. Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the
State.
2. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or
to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no
account be neglected.
3. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors,
to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when
seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.
4. These are: (1) the Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth;
(4) the Commander; (5) method and discipline.
5. The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord
with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless
of their lives, undismayed by any danger.


Chapter 2
Waging War
1. Sun Tzu said: In the operations of war, where there are in
the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots,
and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers, with provisions
enough to carry them a thousand Li, the expenditure
at home and at the front, including entertainment of
guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums
spent on chariots and armour, will reach the total of a
thousand ounces of silver per day. Such is the cost of
raising an army of 100,000 men.
2. When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in
coming, then men's weapons will grow dull and their ardour
will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will
exhaust your strength.
3. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the
State will not be equal to the strain.
4. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardour
damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure
spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of
your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able
to avert the consequences that must ensue.
5. Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.

Peter Pan (Peter and Wendy)
J.M. Barrie

Chapter 1
PETER BREAKS THROUGH
All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they
will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when
she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she
plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose
she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling
put her hand to her heart and cried, "Oh, why can't you remain
like this for ever!" This was all that passed between them on
the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow
up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of
the end.
Of course they lived at 14 [their house number on their
street], and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one.
She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet
mocking mouth. Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes,
one within the other, that come from the puzzling East,
however many you discover there is always one more; and her
sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never
get, though there it was, perfectly conspicuous in the righthand
corner.

Tales of Time and Space
H.G. Wells

Part 1
THE CRYSTAL EGG

There was, until a year ago, a little and very grimy-looking
shop near Seven Dials, over which, in weather-worn yellow lettering,
the name of "C. Cave, Naturalist and Dealer in Antiquities,"
was inscribed. The contents of its window were curiously
variegated. They comprised some elephant tusks and an imperfect
set of chessmen, beads and weapons, a box of eyes, two
skulls of tigers and one human, several moth-eaten stuffed
monkeys (one holding a lamp), an old-fashioned cabinet, a
flyblown ostrich egg or so, some fishing-tackle, and an extraordinarily
dirty, empty glass fish-tank. There was also, at
the moment the story begins, a mass of crystal, worked into
the shape of an egg and brilliantly polished. And at that two
people, who stood outside the window, were looking, one of
them a tall, thin clergyman, the other a black-bearded young
man of dusky complexion and unobtrusive costume. The dusky
young man spoke with eager gesticulation, and seemed
anxious for his companion to purchase the article.

While they were there, Mr. Cave came into his shop, his
beard still wagging with the bread and butter of his tea. When
he saw these men and the object of their regard, his countenance
fell. He glanced guiltily over his shoulder, and softly shut
the door. He was a little old man, with pale face and peculiar
watery blue eyes; his hair was a dirty grey, and he wore a
shabby blue frock coat, an ancient silk hat, and carpet slippers
very much down at heel. He remained watching the two men
as they talked. The clergyman went deep into his trouser pocket,
examined a handful of money, and showed his teeth in an
agreeable smile. Mr. Cave seemed still more depressed when
they came into the shop.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
Francis Scott Fitzgerald

1.
As long ago as 1860 it was the proper thing to be born at
home. At present, so I am told, the high gods of medicine have
decreed that the first cries of the young shall be uttered upon
the anesthetic air of a hospital, preferably a fashionable one.
So young Mr. and Mrs. Roger Button were fifty years ahead of
style when they decided, one day in the summer of 1860, that
their first baby should be born in a hospital. Whether this anachronism
had any bearing upon the astonishing history I am
about to set down will never be known.
I shall tell you what occurred, and let you judge for yourself.
The Roger Buttons held an enviable position, both social and
financial, in ante-bellum Baltimore. They were related to the
This Family and the That Family, which, as every Southerner
knew, entitled them to membership in that enormous peerage
which largely populated the Confederacy. This was their first
experience with the charming old custom of having babies—
Mr. Button was naturally nervous. He hoped it would be
a boy so that he could be sent to Yale College in Connecticut,
at which institution Mr. Button himself had been known

The Scarlet Plague

Jack London

Chapter 1
THE way led along upon what had once been the embankment
of a railroad. But no train had run upon it for many years. The
forest on either side swelled up the slopes of the embankment
and crested across it in a green wave of trees and bushes. The
trail was as narrow as a man's body, and was no more than a
wild-animal runway. Occasionally, a piece of rusty iron, showing
through the forest-mould, advertised that the rail and the
ties still remained. In one place, a ten-inch tree, bursting
through at a connection, had lifted the end of a rail clearly into
view. The tie had evidently followed the rail, held to it by the
spike long enough for its bed to be filled with gravel and rotten
leaves, so that now the crumbling, rotten timber thrust itself
up at a curious slant. Old as the road was, it was manifest that
it had been of the mono-rail type.
An old man and a boy travelled along this runway. They
moved slowly, for the old man was very old, a touch of palsy
made his movements tremulous, and he leaned heavily upon
his staff. A rude skull-cap of goat-skin protected his head from
the sun. From beneath this fell a scant fringe of stained and
dirty-white hair. A visor, ingeniously made from a large leaf,
shielded his eyes, and from under this he peered at the way of
his feet on the trail. His beard, which should have been snowwhite
but which showed the same weather-wear and campstain
as his hair, fell nearly to his waist in a great tangled
mass. About his chest and shoulders hung a single, mangy garment
of goat-skin. His arms and legs, withered and skinny, betokened
extreme age, as well as did their sunburn and scars
and scratches betoken long years of exposure to the elements.
